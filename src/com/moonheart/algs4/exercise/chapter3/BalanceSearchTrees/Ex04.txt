3.3.4 Prove that the height of a 2-3 tree with N keys is between ~ ⎣log3 N⎦
.63 lg N (for a tree that is all 3-nodes) and ~⎣lg N⎦ (for a tree that is all
2-nodes).

Ans:
if all the node is 3-node, then the height is ⎣log3 N⎦, if all the node is 2-node, then the
height is ⎣lg N⎦. So it always comes between these two values.
