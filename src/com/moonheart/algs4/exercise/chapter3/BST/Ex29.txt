3.2.29 Binary tree check. Write a recursive method isBinaryTree() that takes a Node
as argument and returns true if the subtree count field N is consistent in the data structure
rooted at that node, false otherwise. Note : This check also ensures that the data
structure has no cycles and is therefore a binary tree (!).

Ans:The cycle occurs if a node has more than one parent, so the
public boolean isBinaryTree(Node node) {
    if(node == null) return true;
    if(node.size != node.left.size + node.right.size) return false;
    return isBinaryTree(node.left) && isBinaryTree(node.right);
}
