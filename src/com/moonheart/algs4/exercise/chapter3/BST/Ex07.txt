3.2.7 Add to BST a recursive method avgCompares() that computes the average number
of compares required by a random search hit in a given BST (the internal path
length of the tree divided by its size, plus one). Develop two implementations: a recursive
method (which takes linear time and space proportional to the height), and a
method like size() that adds a field to each node in the tree (and takes linear space and
constant time per query).

Ans:

//recursive method
public double avgCompares() {

}
