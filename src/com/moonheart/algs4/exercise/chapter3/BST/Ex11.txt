3.2.11 How many binary tree shapes of N nodes are there with height N? How many
different ways are there to insert N distinct keys into an initially empty BST that result
in a tree of height N? (See Exercise 3.2.2.)

Ans:
For the level 1, you can pick up N nodes as the root, let's say you pick up the ith node(1<=i<=N)
so there are i-1 nodes on the left and N-i nodes on the right. Based on the fact we can develop
the mathematics induction formula.
N(n) =
