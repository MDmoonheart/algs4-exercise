4.3.3 Show that if a graphâ€™s edges all have distinct weights, the MST is unique.

Ans:
Otherwise, there is only two possible case: the other MST has larger weight than the current one or smaller than the
current one.
For the former one, if the MST weight total is larger than the current one, then it is not MST.
For the latter one, if the MST weight total is smaller than the current one, then the current one is not MST.

Both of them are contradictory to the premises.
