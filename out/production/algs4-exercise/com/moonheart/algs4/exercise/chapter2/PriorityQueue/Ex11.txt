2.4.11 Suppose that your application will have a huge number of insert operations, but
only a few remove the maximum operations. Which priority-queue implementation do
you think would be most effective: heap, unordered array, or ordered array?

Ans:
unordered array, because unordered array only sort the array only when the remove operation
is called, and the insert overhead is the least which is just O(1).
