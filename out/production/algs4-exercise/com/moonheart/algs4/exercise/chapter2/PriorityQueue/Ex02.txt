Criticize the following idea: To implement find the maximum in constant time,
why not use a stack or a queue, but keep track of the maximum value inserted so far,
then return that value for find the maximum?

Ans:
The idea is only valid if only the maximum of all time is interested, when you want to find
second largest, then it would not work.
